# xarray Tricks
This is a collection of examples covering anything that I found surprising or difficult when using xarray. I hope someone else finds it useful.

## The examples
1. [Keeping attributes and CF compliance.](Attributes.ipynb)
2. Grouped averages over year and month using `apply_ufunc`.
3. Applying an operation by month using `apply_ufunc`.
4. Using **dask localcluster** to multi process/thread.
